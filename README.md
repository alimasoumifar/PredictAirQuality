Predicting Air Quality Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to predict air quality in a specific region based on historical data and meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict air quality and provide insights into which factors have the most significant impact on air pollution.
Data Collection

The project will use publicly available air quality data from government agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States or the European Environment Agency (EEA) in Europe. Meteorological data will be obtained from weather APIs or scraping weather data from websites.
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

The data will be cleaned, preprocessed, and feature-engineered to prepare it for machine learning algorithms. This may include removing missing values, scaling data, and creating new features by combining existing ones.
Model Development

Various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests will be trained and evaluated on the preprocessed data. The model that provides the best accuracy will be chosen as the final model.
Model Deployment

The final model will be deployed as an API using Flask or Django. The API will take input parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed and return the predicted air quality index for the specified location.
Technologies Used

    Python
    Scikit-learn
    Flask/Django
    Pandas
    NumPy
    Matplotlib/Seaborn

Expected Outcome

The project aims to provide accurate predictions of air quality, which can be used by individuals, policymakers, and organizations to make informed decisions about their daily activities, health, and environmental impact. The project will also demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems to benefit society.
